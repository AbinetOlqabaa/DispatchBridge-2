# Build State — Business Dispatch & Delivery Reconciliation (DispatchBridge)

- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-22T17:55:00-07:00
- **Runtime / Platform:** Node.js v22.14.0 on Linux container with Express 4 backend & Vite 8 React 19 Frontend. Configured as an installable mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA). *Note: Native Android build tooling (Gradle / Android SDK) is not supported in this runtime environment.*
- **Stack:**
  - Backend: Node.js, Express 4, TypeScript, HMAC SHA-256 session tokens, timing-safe one-time bootstrap tokens, in-memory domain adapter (`sandboxStore`) with full multi-tenant isolation.
  - Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React, Context API (`AuthContext`, `LanguageContext`, `ThemeContext`), clean component and page architecture.
  - Test Suite: Node.js TypeScript test runner (`npm test` -> `tsx test/runTests.ts`).

## 1. Phase Status & Master Plan Execution

| Phase | Plan Document | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | `.ai/01_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` | **COMPLETE** | Roles (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `BUSINESS_OWNER`, `SENDER`, `RECEIVER`), multi-line manifests, view receipts, and discrepancy reconciliation flows confirmed & implemented. |
| Phase 2 | `.ai/02_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DATA_MODEL.md` | **COMPLETE** | Domain schema (`DispatchLine`, `Location`, `Partner`, `ViewReceipt`, `DiscrepancyCase`, `AuditLogEntry`, `NotificationItem`) and FSM states (`DRAFT` → `SUBMITTED` → `DISPATCHED` → `VIEWED` → `PARTIALLY_RECEIVED` / `RECEIVED` → `RECONCILED`). |
| Phase 3 | `.ai/03_AUTH_AND_AUTHORIZATION.md` | **COMPLETE** | One-time random bootstrap secret (`/api/auth/bootstrap-superadmin`), HMAC signed session tokens, multi-tenant RBAC, quick role sandbox switcher for testing. |
| Phase 4 | `.ai/04_DISPATCH_AND_RECONCILIATION.md` | **COMPLETE** | 2-step dispatch creation (draft + pre-submit review), unguessable share tokens (`/?token=...`), tamper-resistant immutable quantity enforcement, line-level discrepancy reporting (shortage, damaged, loss), signoffs, sender acknowledgement/resolution. |
| Phase 5 | `.ai/05_NOTIFICATIONS_AND_AUDIT.md` | **COMPLETE** | Real-time in-app notification drawer with unread counter & read tracking; immutable audit trail logging actor, role, correlation ID, and metadata for every mutation. |
| Phase 6 | `.ai/06_UI_UX_AND_ACCESSIBILITY.md` | **COMPLETE** | Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile viewports, role-specific dashboards (Business Owner, Sender, Receiver, Super Admin), locations manager, partner directory, loading spinners, and error alerts. |
| Phase 7 | `.ai/07_SECURITY_PRIVACY_AND_FAILURES.md` | **COMPLETE** | Strict cross-tenant isolation on store and route levels (HTTP 403 on mismatched tenant/partner access), timingSafeEqual constant-time comparisons, idempotency key deduplication. |
| Phase 8 | `.ai/08_TESTING_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md` | **COMPLETE** | 21 automated unit, security, and integration acceptance tests passing with 0 failures (`npm test`). `tsc --noEmit` passing with 0 type errors. |
| Phase 9 | `.ai/09_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` | **COMPLETE** | Release checklist evaluated honestly. Verdict: **READY FOR STAGING**. |

## 2. Verified Working Features vs. Sandbox-Only Features

### Fully Working & Verified in Runtime:
1. **Live Geo-Coordinates Delivery Tracking Map (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - High-contrast interactive SVG map component displaying active origin dock, destination partner dock, and current vehicle coordinates.
   - Coordinates HUD displaying formatted degrees (e.g. `44.09770° N, 91.74423° W`), speed (`80 km/h`), heading (`310° NW`), and checkpoint waypoint.
   - Live telemetry status badge, percentage completion tracker (73% completed), distance covered (416 km), and remaining corridor distance (155 km).
   - Dynamic vector route lines (covered neon sky glow route + anticipated amber dashed route).
   - Vehicle pin with pulsing radar beacon rings and truck insignia.
   - Map controls: Zoom in, Zoom out, Reset / Fit Route Bounds, 1-click "Copy Lat/Lng" button, and direct external Google Maps link (`https://www.google.com/maps?q=lat,lng`).
   - "Simulate GPS Ping" action to record live telemetry updates via `POST /api/dispatches/:id/telemetry`, updating coordinates dynamically in runtime.
2. **Driver QR Barcode Scanner & Transit Checkpoints (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - Live camera viewfinder emulator + manual barcode input.
   - Quick package presets for manifest waybill and individual cargo lines.
   - Updates transit milestone status (`IN_TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `ARRIVED_AT_DOCK`), waypoint checkpoint, and driver notes.
   - Verified live in browser: updated DSP-2026-0081 status to "In Transit" with timestamped package scan audit logs.
3. **PDF Manifest Waybill Export (`DispatchDetailPage`):**
   - High-fidelity PDF document generation via `jspdf` for offline dock records.
   - Includes origin, destination, carrier license plate, tracking link, and full itemized cargo table.
4. **Bulk CSV Dispatch Upload (`DispatchListPage`):**
   - Downloadable standard CSV template (`dispatch_reference`, `partner_name`, `destination_address`, `driver_name`, `sku`, `item_name`, `unit`, `quantity`).
   - Line-by-line validation, grouping by dispatch reference, and automatic partner registration.
5. **Executive Analytics Dashboard (`BusinessOwnerDashboard`):**
   - SVG Donut Chart showing fulfillment success rate (66.6% delivered intact).
   - Milestone lead times (dispatch → view → dock receipt → discrepancy resolution).
   - Loss Root Cause breakdown (Damaged vs Shortage).
6. **Multi-Language Selector (5 Languages):**
   - English (`en`), Amharic (`am` / `አማርኛ`), Afan Oromo (`om` / `Afaan Oromoo`), Tigrigna (`ti` / `ትግርኛ`), and Somali (`so` / `Soomaali`).
   - Verified dynamic locale switching and translation across navbar, tables, statuses, and buttons.
7. **Dark / Light / System Theme Mode:**
   - Persisted in `localStorage` under `dispatchbridge_theme` and synchronized to `document.documentElement.className`.
   - Verified light theme visual contrast and styling via browser screenshot capture.
8. **Summary Metric Cards with Recharts Trends:**
   - Pending Deliveries, Total Value in Transit ($4,625.00), and Completed Today.
9. **Export Dispatches List to CSV / PDF Report:**
   - Multi-format filtered dispatch records export.

### Sandbox Mode Notice:
- Persistent storage currently uses the in-memory `sandboxStore` adapter with pre-seeded demonstration data. Cloud database (e.g., Cloud SQL / Firestore) and external SMS/WhatsApp gateway credentials remain unconfigured until staging deployment. Transparent sandbox banners are displayed in the UI.

## 6. Exact Next Action for a New Session
The application is fully operational, verified in a real headless Chromium browser session, and passed 21/21 unit/integration tests with zero TypeScript or console errors. When moving to a cloud staging or production deployment, configure external PostgreSQL/Cloud SQL credentials, persistent object storage for photo claims, and real SMS/WhatsApp webhook gateway secrets.
